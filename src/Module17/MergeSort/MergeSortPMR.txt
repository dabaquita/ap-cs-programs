PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: The merge sort algorithm was better understood
        after watching a couple of videos in addition
        to the eIMACS. Afterwards, it was simple to
        implement in the movie list.

<-s>: No problems.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to use merge sort.
