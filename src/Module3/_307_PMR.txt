            user input and process the data to format an
            output.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to properly and easily use the Scanner
        class to complete the objective of containing user
        input data for use in formatted output. It was
        especially useful that I could create just one
        Scanner object for use in other lines of input
        I needed.

<-s>: An error occurred where I asked for String input
        followed by int input then again String input
        line-by-line in the code and the output displayed
        incorrectly and didn't work as expected. This was
        new, but I solved it by placing the String inputs
        together and the int inputs together.

In the future: I will be able to use the Scanner class to
                make more interactive programs than before.
