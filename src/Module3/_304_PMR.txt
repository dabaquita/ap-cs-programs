Project: Escape Sequences // ArtWork.java
Purpose: To practice the use of string objects with
            escape sequences in order to display a String
            drawing.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to use escape sequences properly and
        assign String literals into String objects. This
        will definitely prove useful when I need to format
        a String concisely in Java.

<-s>: After the initial compilation, my output was not in
        the proper format that I intended it to be because
        I didn't consider the backslashes within escape
        sequences in my code. Because of that, some
        characters were not in the proper place, so the
        drawing was not complete. I did fix it, however.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to keep in mind the
                usefulness of String objects and escape
                sequences and use them when using Strings
                in my programs.
