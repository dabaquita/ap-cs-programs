Project: 3.09 Challenge Program // BuyVideoGame.java
Purpose: Prompts the user for name, date, item to be bought,
            the number of the items, the price of the item,
            and debit card and PIN numbers in order to
            create an e-receipt with specified output.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to use some planning techniques as well
        as pseudocode to plan out this challenge program.
        I am positive that this helped me reach success
        easily and quickly, running into the least amount
        of problems as possible. Also, I was able to
        efficiently use the Scanner class and variable
        assignments as well as parsing in this program.

<-s>: The only problem I ran into was using nextLine()
        instead of next(), which caused a few problems
        in the user input prompt. However, it was solved.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be able to make quicker programs after
                practicing using pseudocode for an actual
                project program.
