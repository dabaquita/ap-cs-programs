Project:  Defining New Static Methods //
          PlanetGravity.java & PlanetWeight.java
Purpose: To learn how to use methods in creating
            more modular and object oriented programs.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I found it much easier to finally use modular
        programming to write my programs. My code resulted
        in a more concise and readable format, and
        there were far fewer problems that occurred.

<-s>: I did not know that I needed the main method to
        also throw an IOException within PlanetWeight.java
        despite one of my other methods handling it, but
        now I learned it and both throw the exception.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to use methods to make my
                programs reflect object oriented
                programming and be able to write
                and debug code easier.
