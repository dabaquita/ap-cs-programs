PlanetWeight.java

import Scanner
import IOException
import File

-- Main Method --

Variables -
String[] planets = {Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
                    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune}
double[] gravity, weightInLbs
double givenWeight

Processing -
assign gravity to readGravityData() return value

assign givenWeight to userWeightPrompt return value

assign weightInLbs to weightInPlanets(gravity, givenWeight) return value

Output -
formatTable(planets, gravity, weightInLbs)

-----------------


-- readGravityData() throws IOException--
    -> double[] gravity <-

Variables -
Scanner inFile
double[] gravityArray

Processing -
i = 0
while gravity has data to be read
    assign data to gravityArray[i]
    increment i

return gravityArray
-----------------------------------------


-- userWeightPrompt() --
    -> double weight <-

Variables -
Scanner input
double weight

Processing -
Prompt user for weight in lbs
    assign to weight

return weight

-------------------------


-- weightInPlanets() --
(double[] gravity, double weight) --> double[] weightArray

Variables -
double[] weightArray (same length as gravity)
double earthGravity = 9.79

Processing -
for as int i = 0, while it is less than gravity length, increment
    assign weightArray[i] the product of gravity[i] and ( weight / earthGravity)

return weightArray

-----------------------


-- formatTable() --
(String[], double[], double[]) --> void

printf "My weight on the planets" as header
printf "Planet", "Gravity", and "Weight (lbs)" as column headers

for int i = 0, while it is less than String[] length, increment
    printf planet[i], gravity[i], and weight[i]
