Project: Module 7 Challenge Program // EstimatePi.java
Purpose: Use modular programming to calculate the value
            of pi by simulating throwing darts at a
            dart board.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I understood the concepts well, and I was able to
        incorporate modular programming well into this
        without much trouble. It also made this program
        easier.

        Also, as the number of darts increases or the
        number of trials increases, the estimate gets
        closer to the value of pi.

<-s>: The only time I had trouble was forgetting to
        cast int into double within the executeTrials().
        This resulted in 0's for my results, so after
        only a little time, I was able to then fix it
        because the separation code into methods.

In the future: I'll be able to more easily separate my
                programming problems into parts and save
                time by making code easier to create
                on top of debugging.
