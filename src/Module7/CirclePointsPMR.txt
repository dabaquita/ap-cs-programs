Project: 7.01 Java's Math Class // CirclePoints.java
Purpose: To use Java's Math class in order to calculate
            from given values of a circle to points
            on that circle.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I learned how to use Java's Math class as well
        as increased my understanding of loops and
        printf() through this exercise.

<-s>: At first, I used a for loop in formatting the
        output table, but I soon realized this would not
        be the case. After a few days of just thinking it
        over, I realized that I should stop playing
        with the for loop and try other methods. As a
        result, I was able to realize how the while
        loop could be used, resulting in a successful
        program.

In the future: I will be able to use Java's Math class
                in performing arithmetic essential in
                most programs as well as discern between
                using for loops and while loops.
