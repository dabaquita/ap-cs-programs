Project:  9.04 Challenge // Catapult.java & CatapultTester.java
Purpose: To learn about 2D arrays and implement them using
            methods and data from an object class.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: This was not bad at all! I loved using the 2D arrays
        since it made the output a little bit easier
        to display as well as placing large amounts of
        data into one variable.

<-s>: I forgot "i++" in the beginning of a for loop, and
        nothing in the output window resulted from my
        code. It took a while to find, but I got it in
        the end.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to use 2D arrays more
                efficiently.
