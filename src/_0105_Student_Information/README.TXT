<+s>: This exercise was good in getting back to shape in Java!
        It reminded me of how Java uses print() and println()
        statements, which is always good and will be useful for
        future assignments.

<-s>: There were times where I kept running before checking my
        code for syntax error. Sometimes, I forgot to include a
        semi-colon.

--------------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll make sure to pay attention and be careful,
                I can make sure that I will have good foundations
                in Java.
