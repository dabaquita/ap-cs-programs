Purpose: To practice OOP by recreating a real life object

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: OOP style seems much easier and more organized
        than previously used styles. I like how programs
        can mimic real life objects, and I now further
        understand more about how programs like apps
        and the computer works by dividing up tasks
        that can be recalled again.

<-s>: I did not have any problems.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will use OOP in appropriate situations
                and will easily be able to make
                more organized programs.
