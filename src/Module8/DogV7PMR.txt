<+s>: Object Oriented Programming is seriously still
        one of my favorite style of programming
        and still wows me with how much versatility it
        provides.

<-s>: There were no problems!

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will continue to use OOP and continue
                practicing it since practice does make
                perfect or close to it!
