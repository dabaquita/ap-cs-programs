PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: This was not a bad programming challenge to get
        experience with array lists and more OOP! I
        loved it and how everything turned out amazingly
        smoothly.

<-s>: I forgot that the format specifier for integer
        numbers are marked with "d" not "f", so I had
        to look back into my notes to solve that
        problem in the last printf of the implementation
        class.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: Array lists will be widely used in conjunctin
                with regular arrays if need be and OOP!
