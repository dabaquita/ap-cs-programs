Project:  8.08 // DogV8.java & DogV8Tester.java
Purpose: To use accessor, mutator, setter, and
            getter methods to display a table
            of instance variables from objects.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: Accessor, mutator, setter, and getter methods were
        easy to implement, and the code was not as
        extensive as I thought it would be! It was
        much easier to plan and code this one!

<-s>: I over thought a portion of the processing part of
        the main method in the  implementation class, but
        I was able to fix it after noticing how my
        code was too extensive to make sense.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be using these types of methods to make
                object oriented programs.
