Project:  8.12 Challenge // Hurricane.java & HurricaneTester.java
Purpose: To modify a previously created program using OOP
            to make the program less extensive and more
            readable and reusable.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: There were very little problems in using OOP
        to recreate this program. I loved how I could
        go back into my code and improve on it and
        truly examine how and why I did things in the
        past.

<-s>: There were no problems.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be using OOP whenever possible
                and maybe even look back at my old
                code and improve on it.
