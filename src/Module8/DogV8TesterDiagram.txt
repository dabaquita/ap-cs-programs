--- Main Method ---

Variables -
DogV8[] kennel
    "Kenny", "Beagle"
    "Sally", "Beagle"
    "Kevin", "Beagle"
    "Dan", "Beagle"
    "Bear", "Beagle"
int randomNum
double max = MIN_VALUE,
       min = MAX_VALUE,
       sum,
       average
int[] randNumArray

Processing -
for loop (int i; iterates 5 times)
    create randomNum from 0 - 4
    for loop (int j; checks for randomNum repetition)
        if randomNum equals randNumArray at index j
            generate new randomNum
        else
            assign randNumArray at index i the randomNum

    kennel[randomNum].setWeight = random from [8, 12]

    assign randomNum to either 0 or 1
    if randomNum is equal to 0
        kennel[randNumArray[i]].setCleanliness to true
    else
        kennel[randNumArray[i]].setCleanliness to false

    for loop (int k; generate random number from 0 - 5 as limit
        kennel[randNumArray[i]].fetch(randomNum)
        kennel[randNumArray[i]].eatFood()
         if randomNum is 1
            takeBath

for each loop
    if getWeight > max
        then getWeight is max
    else if getWeight < min
        then getWeight is min
    add getWeight to sum

calculate average from sum and kennel.length

Output -
Present a table of the objects
    for each loop
        printf getName, getBreed, getWeight, getCleanliness

    Printf min, max, average
