Project:  6.04 Challenge Program // HurricaneSelector.java
Purpose: To use arrays and format specifiers properly on
            top of bringing all concepts that have been
            learned so far into one challenge program.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to make the code well organized despite
        the extensiveness of it all. Additionally, I was
        able to use format specifiers as well as arrays
        fairly efficiently in accomplishing this program.

<-s>: There were multiple bugs during and after the entire
        creation of this program. Specifically, I found
        that I incorrectly programmed how the program
        was to take in data line by line, which led to
        a lot of frustration. Also, some of the parts
        of my program were unordered, so I had to
        rearrange them accordingly. Overall, this process
        taught me how to effectively problem solve and
        debug a program to its deepest levels so far.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be more efficient in writing my
                programs as well as be able to more
                quickly point out bugs and fix them
                accordingly.
