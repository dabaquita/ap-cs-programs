Project: 5.06 Writing Text Files // AnimalPopulation.java
Purpose: Use the lessons learned in reading and writing
            text files to create a program that creates
            a text file with data and processes that data.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to properly use the skills learned on
        how to read and write text files in Java to create
        this program. Also, I have become more comfortable
        in using print statements to test code and
        run everything in increments as the final project
        is finished.

<-s>: I ran into a problem where I forgot to parse
        a String for its Integer value and obtained
        "Infinity" as the output for averageNumOfSquirrels.
        However, I quickly came to realize this after
        doing some tests.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to efficiently create and
                test programs through the skills learned
                in this module's program.
