PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to use the File class properly with
        no problems in processing text data.

<-s>: I had trouble solving the problem of how to round
        to 2 decimal places using casting, so I asked
        for help in an email. The problem was solved
        after I further experimented with how it worked.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to use the File class
                in processing text file data as well
                as use casting to specify double format.
