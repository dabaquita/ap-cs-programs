PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to plan pseudocode and see the program
        in pieces before starting the process of coding.
        This helped make things easier, especially when
        there were bugs to deal wtih.

<-s>: There was an error where the while loop infinitely
        continued, causing the passwords.txt to take up
        25 GB from my computer! However, I was able to
        solve it and make the program a success.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be able to see programs more easily
                in pieces and then plan them accordingly.
                Also, my problem-solving skills are
                constantly improving.
