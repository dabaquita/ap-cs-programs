            and variables to create an encryption
            and decryption program.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: The 'static' keyword really helped make this program
        easier by withholding the usage of the instance
        within method declarations, allowing for
        an easier and cleaner appearance to the code.
        Plus, it makes things like keeping values
        consistent among all instances easier.

<-s>: There were several bugs in the end that involved
        incorrect output structure as well as incorrect
        cipher alphabet generation, but everything
        was solved in a matter of a sitting.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: Static will be used wisely.
