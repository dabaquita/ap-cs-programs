Project: Challenge Program // CurrencyV1.java
Purpose: To practice casting and arithmetic operations
            in further detail using int and double
            variables along with practicing problem-
            solving to get a desired output with code
            restrictions.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to easily do the currency conversions
        and properly format the displayed output according
        to the instructions and example. I also learned
        how to back-solve even more efficiently from
        Souvenir exercise.

<-s>: Figuring out the Souvenir exercise expressions were
        more time consuming because I didn't realize how
        to incorporate the modulus operator along with
        the variables to perform the desired task. It was
        vital in calculating fundsRemaining.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be more efficient because I know even
                more about how to use the modulus operator
                and about casting to obtain desired results.
