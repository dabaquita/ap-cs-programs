Purpose: Use integer and double variables and concatenations for
            easily readable arithmetic operations in output.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------------

<+s>: This was a good way to practice using print() and println()
        to achieve readable arithmetic operations in the output.
        More importantly, it was a good way to practice the
        order of operations as well as concatenations and the usage
        of variables within code.

<-s>: There weren't any errors or parts where I had trouble with, but
        I did pay careful attention to concatenations and quotation marks
        and worked to make sure that the output would be readable.

--------------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be able to implement concatenations better than before
                to display readable output.
