            and casting in order to keep track of total
            points and calculate average score.

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was easily able to see what I had to do in order
        to accomplish the given output and didn't run into
        many problems or errors. Also, I learned that casting
        can occur within print() and println() statements
        in the case where 95.0 could be 95.

<-s>: The only error that did occur was a runtime error
        because the numbers weren't properly formatted in
        accordance to the instructions. I only forgot to
        cast my variables within the arithmetic operations.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be able to look at the output display
                and be able to more easily identify the
                steps necessary to accomplish the task.
                I'll begin by writing pseudocode as
                problems get more difficult as well.
