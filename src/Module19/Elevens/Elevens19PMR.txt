PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: Mostly everything went well, mostly the worksheet
        and outlining the program and grasping an
        understanding of it as a whole and in parts.

<-s>: I was not aware of the cardAt() method until I
        reread the entire ElevensBoard class, so I had
        a few bugs regarding selection and pairing.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to analyze a similar
                program and maybe even make one of my
                own.
