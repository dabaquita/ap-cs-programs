PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to properly use if-else-if statements to
        get the desired output for the BMI categories.
        Also, having a plan and some pseudocode beforehand
        truly helped the process become easier and faster
        than expected.

<-s>: I ran into a runtime error where the String
        heightInStr variable included the space in its
        value. Because of this, the variable could not be
        parsed into an integer, so I had to change methods
        from in.nextLine() to in.next().

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be able to be more aware in the usage
                of nextLine() and next(). Also, I'll be
                able to use if-else-if statements in my
                future programs!
