Project: 4.07 Logical Operators // TDEE.java

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to use logical operators properly within
        this program as well as the equalsIgnoreCase()
        method which truly helped make the program more
        readable and smaller.

<-s>: However, I found a way a way to make the program
        more object-oriented based off of experience, but
        I noticed that I needed to use logical operators
        from reading the directions after making my plan.
        I should read the directions more carefully.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to use these new methods and
                operators to make even more complicated but
                concise programs as well as know to read the
                directions more carefully.
