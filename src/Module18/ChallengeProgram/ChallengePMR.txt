PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: I was able to efficiently make use of the algorithms
        that I learned in this challenging and extensive
        program.

<-s>: It was a little difficult remembering the algorithms
        and how to implement them, but through this
        program, I was able to practice and memorize and
        truly understand the concepts.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be able to use multiple sorting
                searching algorithms as appropriate.
