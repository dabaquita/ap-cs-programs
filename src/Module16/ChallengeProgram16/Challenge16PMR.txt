PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: From scratch, I was able to traverse, insert,
        and delete the elements of objects within
        array lists easily based on the previous
        assignments.

<-s>: I forgot to include a break statement in one of the
        for loops, which caused an infinite loop and the
        eventual crash of my program.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I'll be able to use these skills in
                further arrays and array lists.
