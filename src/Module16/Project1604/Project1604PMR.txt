Purpose: Insertions and deletions with arrays

PMR-----------------------------------------------------

<+s>: Everything went well! Both insertions
        and deletions with arrays and array lists are
        being more easily understood with more practice.
        I noticed how array lists are significantly more
        efficient with these algorithms by decreased
        amounts of code compared to arrays.

<-s>: No problems.

--------------------------------------------------------

In the future: I will be more efficient in inserting
                and deleting elements in both arrays and
                array lists.
